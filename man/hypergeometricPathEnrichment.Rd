\title{hypergeometric Path Enrichment analysis function for summaryTable interface.}
\usage{
hypergeometricPathEnrichment(pathSigRunner, paths_detail)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathSigRunner}{An object of the PathSummaryRunner reference class}

\item{paths_detail}{An object of the Path_Detail class}
}
\value{
data.frame with two columns, one with hypergeometric p-values for each path, the other with B.Y./FDR adjusted p-value.
}
\description{
Provides hypergeometric test for analysis of pathway enrichment. Implements interface from the summaryTable function to path significance tests.
}
\note{
Implements the path test interface with one input, the path summary list, and the output, a data.frame with pathway names as row name(s) and named column(s) giving the result of the significance test.
}
