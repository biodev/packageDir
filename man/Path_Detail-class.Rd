\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{name}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} The name of the pathway repository used. }
\item{\code{file}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} The file from which the pathway repostory was loaded.}
\item{\code{date}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} The date the pathway repository was loaded.}
\item{\code{info}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} Any additional information reguarding the pathway repository.}
\item{\code{source}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} The source of the pathway repository. For example, Reactome, via the graphite bioconductor package )}
\item{\code{graphite}:}{Depricated. Only here for legacy purposes.} 
\item{\code{gene_overlap_counts}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"} One column, with row names given as gene names. Values are the number of pathways each gene belongs to.} 
\item{\code{full_path_length}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"} One column, pathway names given as row names. Values given as the number of genes annotated to each pathway.}
\item{\code{symtable}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"} The official, approved set of symbols or gene identifiers and any cross references.}
\item{\code{paths}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"} The actual storage of pathways in bipartate graph format, with row names as the path names, column names as gene identifiers and values logical representing gene membership in pathawys.}
\item{\code{symbol_type}:}{Object of class \code{"character"} The type of gene identiers used, for example HUGO or Uniprot.}
