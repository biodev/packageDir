\usage{
getPaths(path_file = NULL,
  referenceFileName = "./reference_data/paths/pathMetaData.txt",
  symtab = NULL, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_file}{String giving path to file from which pathways should be loaded. Alternatively, a \code{Study} object can be provided here and pathways will automatically be retreived from it.}

\item{referenceFileName}{Optional. String giving path to file where pathway meta data (date loaded, path repository name, etc..) can be found.}

\item{symtab}{A gene identifier lookup table. If not provided, one will be automatically obtained (may take longer)}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag indicating if interactive user prompts and additional information should be displayed.}
}
\value{
\code{Path_Detail} object.
}
\description{
Get \code{Path_Detail} object, housing gene sets for cellular pathways.
}
\details{
Pathways are stored in the local working directory in the folder \code{./reference_data/paths/}. 
Pathways must be imported into this package so that meta-data and import records can be maintained. 
Path meta data is stored in the file \code{./reference_data/paths/pathMetaData.txt} . Any time a path
repository is imported, a record of its import is added to the path meta data file. When loading a path
repository for use in a study, this program checks the path meta data file, for available path repositories
and for path repository file locations.
}
\examples{

\dontrun{
#select and/or load pathways interactively
path_detail = getPaths()
}

#Get pathways from a study object:
study=getTestStudyObject()
path_detail=getPaths(study)

#select pathways from their file name:
path_detail = getPaths(path_file="./reference_data/paths/Reactome.2014.04.06.12.52.27.txt", 
										verbose=FALSE)
}
