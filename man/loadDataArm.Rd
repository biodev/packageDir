loadDataArm(mainFunction, arms, title, description,
  scriptFile = "no script file provided, loading data arm main function from local environment")

\item{mainFunction}{The main execution function for the arm. 
If the script provided, the function does not need to be loaded 
into memory when the call is made to loadDataArm -- the script

\item{arms}{The list containing all DataArm objects for the 
study.}

\item{title}{character string. The one word description of 
the data arm. (ex: functional_drug_screen_summary) This will 
be used internally to refer to any results associated with the 
data arm, and externally to name folders when saving data.}

\item{description}{The description of the data input arm to 
be used as a main menu option. (ex: "Process drug screen data")}

\item{scriptFile}{A file providing the script where the 
functions implementing the data import arm can be found. 
Note: This allows that a script can be provied which contains 
the definition of the function provided for the mainFunction 
argument. Thus, this script will be executed before the 
mainFunction is called or referened.}
