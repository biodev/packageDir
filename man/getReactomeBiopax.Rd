\description{
Attempts to download biopax files for reactome pathways. First, pathway's individual database identifiers are obtained from bioMART, then restful calls are made to Reactome's restful interface. A record of successfully downloaded pathways is made in the file "./reference_data/paths/biopax/record_of_biopax_pathways.txt" so that pathways will not be repeatedly downloaded.
