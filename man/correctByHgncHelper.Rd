\title{Correct gene symbols using the HGNChelper package}
\usage{
correctByHgncHelper(symbol_set,
  correctionsfile = "./reference_data/gene_symbol_corrections_list.txt",
  symtab = NULL, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol_set}{Vector, matrix or data.frame (if more than 2 dimensions, the symbols must be in the first column)}

\item{correctionsfile}{A file name for a file of gene symbol corrections. This file should be tab delimited and contain two named columns: old_symbol and new_symbol. The old_symbol column contains incorrect identifiers to be corrected, and the new_symbol column contains the corrections. There should be no row names.}

\item{symtab}{The table of official, orthodox gene identifiers. If not provided, the \code{hgnc.table data frame} object from HGNChelper will be used.}

\item{verbose}{A logical flag indicating if interactive mode should be run.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the identifiers for the set of genes provided in the symbol_set function argument, but with any applicable corrections made.
}
\description{
Correct gene symbols using the HGNChelper package. Provides interactive or automatic correction of gene identifiers, and corrdination of any correction between multiple calls to this functions.
