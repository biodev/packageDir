\title{Main pathway analysis function.}
\usage{
summaryTable(study, activeGeneDescription = "active_gene",
  dataSetDescription = "analysis of undefined active genes",
  pgm = NULL, originalDataMatrix = NULL,
  settings = getDefaultSettings()$defaultSummaryTable, coverage = NULL,
  coverageGeneDescription = "covered_gene",
  coverageDataSetDescription = "Coverage analysis",
  individualEnrichment = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{A Study object.}

\item{activeGeneDescription}{One word description of how the 'active' genes should be described (ex: mutated, amplified, drug_sensitive)}

\item{dataSetDescription}{Description of the data set provided for the pathway analysis. (ex: "Somatically mutated genes")}

\item{pgm}{The patient gene matrix for the patient data. Bipartate graph with row names set as gene names, column names set as patient IDs and values logical indicating if gene is considered "active" in patient.}

\item{originalDataMatrix}{The original data matrix. Makes this available for novel types of pathway analysis, not treating genes as discretely "on" or "off"}

\item{settings}{A settings list object controling how the path analysis will be conducted. Default given by call to getDefaultSettings()$defaultSummaryTable .}

\item{coverage}{\code{character vector} of gene names. Should be provided if coverage provided by the analysis platform used to produce gene data entered into this function is not considered to have full genome coverage.}

\item{coverageGeneDescription}{The description of genes that are covered be the analysis platform (ex: drug_targeted or sequenced)}

\item{coverageDataSetDescription}{A longer description of the set of genes provided in the coverage analysis}

\item{individualEnrichment}{logical. A flag indicating if pathway analysis should be run for individual patients.}
}

The main function for conducting a pathway analysis on a set of gene data.
