\usage{
abDrugOverlapAnalysis(study, thresh = 0.05,
  enrich_col = "hyperg_p_w_FDR", verbose = T, settings = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{A study object (must have results loaded for aberration and functional analyses)}

\item{thresh}{Numeric, the threshold used to establish which pathways will be considered to be drug sensitive and aberrational.}

\item{enrich_col}{String, the name of the column in the path summary used to determine significance of a pathway. This is the column to which the threshold argument is to be applied.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, a flag indicating if the program is to provide extra diagnostic output.}

\item{settings}{List obejct. This contains the settings used in the overlap analysis. Use getDefaultOverlapSettings()}
}
\value{
Study object with overlap analysis in results list added or replaced
}
\description{
main function for running analysis of functional and genomic aberration arms
}
\examples{
#get a study object pre-loaded with genomic aberration and functional genomic data.
stud = getTestStudyObject()

#get default overlap analysis settings
defSettings = getTestStudySettings()
overlapSettings = defSettings$overlap_analysis

#run the overlap analysis

overlapRes1 = abDrugOverlapAnalysis(study=stud, settings=overlapSettings)

\dontrun{
#If settings for the overlap analysis cannot be found, the overlap 
#analysis will run in interactive mode, requiring user input.
#This line of code will run the overlap anaysis in interactive mode, 
#requesting user input to establish settings:

abDrugOverlapAnalysis(study=stud)
